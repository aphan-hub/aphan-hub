   in my lived experience, those four words were rarely uttered. 
   my childhood self did not have the words ask my parents,
    
        who are vietnamese refugee immigrants with little knowledge of the english language,
        
   
   
   <i><a href="successes2.html">"how come you aren't proud of me?"</a></i>

        
    not skinny enough. not smart enough. not obedient enough.
    not organized enough. not punctual enough. 
    not pale enough. not quiet enough. <i>not skinny enough.</i>
    
    i'm not <i><a href="successes3.html">enough</a></i>."
    
    
    i remember crying alone in the shower. calling myself ugly. hating everything about myself.
    how i dearly wish to comfort my childhood self that i was always enough.
    that none of that mattered.
