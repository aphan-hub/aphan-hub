    <div style="text-align:center;font-size:145%">"i'm proud of you."
    
    
    
   in my lived experience, those four words were rarely uttered. 
   my childhood self did not have the words ask my parents,
    
        who are vietnamese refugee immigrants with little knowledge of the english language,
        
   
   
   <i><a href="successes2.html">"how come you aren't proud of me?"</a></i>
