    <p style="text-align:center;">"why do i bother being soft and full of feeling,
    when i am truly bitter and angry and full of grief"
    
    
    
    i loved her. i loved him. i loved them.
    whether in monogamy or in polyamory,
    i gave my entire heart to each of them.
    no matter how long i gave them my time,
    they each left a part of them within me.
    
    
    however,
    
    
    <a href="grief2.html">they were not always reciprocal in love.</a>
