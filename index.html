    i feel as if my past is as far away and foreign as many lifetimes ago. 
    as entire lived experiences of other people spanning across decades,
    whose stories somehow managed to all end up back to me.
    as if my soul wants to retroactively split the delicate seams of thread 
    that connect my current self away with my tumultuous past.
    
    
    at the same time, 
    
    i am the collective being of 
    my own <a href="hardships.html">hardships</a>.
