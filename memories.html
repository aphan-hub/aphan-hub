    <div style="text-align:center;font-size:145%">"if memories are how people recall certain events of the past,
    then a person's memories inform their perception of reality."
    
    
    
    
    in a single event, its possible that 
    two people can have two different memories 
    of what occurred.
    
    and if left uncontradicted, 
    those two perceptions of reality can exist 
    at the same moment.
    
    what happens when you inflict trauma onto someone
    without the intention of harm?
    and that someone trusted you and built a home in you.
    
    even if in your <del>memory</del> reality you recall 
    that there was consent (there was none),
    
    
    
    should they forgive you? 
    <i>do you deserve forgiveness?</i>
