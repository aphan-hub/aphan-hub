    <div style="text-align:center;font-size:145%">"why do i bother being soft and full of feeling,
    when i am truly bitter and angry and full of grief"
    
    
    
    i loved her. i loved him. i loved them.
    whether in monogamy or in polyamory,
    i gave my entire heart to each of them.
    no matter how long i gave them my time,
    they each left a part of them within me.
    
    
    however,
    
    
    <a href="grief2.html">they were not always reciprocal in love.</a>
    
    
    
    lies were told. promises broken.
    boundaries crossed. trust manipulated.
    texts ignored. secrets ensued.
    
    after every seemingly genuine apology,
    i stayed.
    
  
    
    but when they left,
    i sat alone in my thoughts.
    
    
    
    i asked myself,
     <i><a href="grief3.html">"what do i do with all this grief?"</a></i>
    
    
    
    what did i do wrong? am i not enough?
    why did they leave me for her?
    
    
    <i>how is it fair to hold all this grief on my own,
    when they are happy with their new partner?</i>
    
    
    i wallowed in my grief for months. 
    i lost weight. i lost color in my flesh.
    i regained weight. i shaved my head.
    i got pierced (again). 
    
    
    
    but most importantly,
    i made <a href="grief4.html">art</a>.
