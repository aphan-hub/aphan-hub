    <p style="text-align:center;">"we are not defined by our hardships but they form a part of who we are." 
    
    
    
    i fear the folks who say that hardships are essential for personal growth.
    "i came out fine," they say
i fear that they have gone their entire life on the basis of survival and scarcity. 
they have never been able to stop and listen to the sound of rain drops on the concrete. 
to relax their shoulders and inhale the scent of soft lavender. 


how can i convince them that wishing harm onto others heals <a href="hardships2.html">no one</a>?
